I am primarily interested 3D computer vision, visual SLAM and Human-Computer-Interaction. I currently work on making robots  perform tasks involving hand-eye coordination using imitation learning at Micropsi-Industries in Berlin. My focus is on using 3D computer vision to facilitate learning with as little demonstration data as possible.

Prior to my current job, I studied Robotics and Computation at the University College London and interned at Tesla as a Software Developer in the Industrial Engineering Department.

In my free time, I like to think about geometric and semantic SLAM. In my other free time, I also like to run, read, play tennis and boulder. Hit me up if you're in town and want to do one of these things!


## This Blog

I started this blog primarily as a tool to collect my thoughts (both technical and otherwise). I think trying to formalise concepts and explain them to other people is one of the best ways to understand them better yourself. The posts herein are an attempt at that. If you find something questionable or disagree with some/all of the content, please get in touch! I'd love to hear your opinion :)

## What the F is "Euclidigoras"?

Due to my limited imagination and all round bad humour, I couldn't think of anything better to name my blog. Euclid was a pretty awesome geometer and Pythagoras' Theorem is the one mathematical formula that I can recall without fail at any given time. Since I'm mainly interested in geometric computer vision and I like sounding smart: Euclidigoras! -->
