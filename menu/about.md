I am primarily interested 3D computer vision, visual SLAM and Human-Computer-Interaction. I currently work at Micropsi-Industries in Berlin on making robots to perform tasks involving hand-eye coordination using imitation learning. My focus is on using as little demonstration data as possible. 

Prior to my current job, I studied Robotics and Computation at the University College London and interned at Tesla as a Software Developer in the Industrial Engineering Department.

In my free time, I like to think about Geometric and Semantic SLAM. In my other free time, I also like to run, read, play tennis and boulder. Hit me up if you're in town and want to do one of these things!


## This Blog

I started this blog primarily as a tool to collect my thoughts (both technical and otherwise). I think trying to formalise concepts and explain them to other people is one of the best ways to understand them better yourselves. The posts herein are an attempt at that. If you find something questionable/disagree with some/all of the content, please get in touch! I'd love to hear from your opinion :)
